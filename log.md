# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 19th, 2021:

Started the Facebook React tutorial with the tic tac toe game and was able to get half way through it in my hour also spent a bunch of time fiddling to get my environment setup

### Day 2: August 20th, 2021:

Finished the tic tac toe project and got a rudementary understanding of react from it there were a few things that flew over my head, but it was good exposure, I also decided to start following this react crash course to get a bit of a more detailed explanation of some of the parts of react such as "this", state, props and hooks
